# YouTube Playlist+
A userscript that extends YouTube's playlist interface with features it should've had already.

## Features
- Adds '**Go to old layout**' link to new playlist pages  
  - *Old layout has superior functionality*
- Adds '**Batch remove videos**' button to old layout  
  - *For clearing your Watch Later playlist of that 583 videos you're never going to watch*

## Installation
1. If you don't have a userscript manager, [install one that's appropriate for your browser](https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO#how-do-i-get-going-)
1. Open [the latest source code file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hosmanadam/youtube-playlist-plus/master/youtube-playlist-plus.user.js) and your userscript manager should recognize it automatically  
   *If it doesn't, copy-paste the source code into a new userscript created in the userscript manager*
